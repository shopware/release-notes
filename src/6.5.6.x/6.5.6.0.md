# Release notes Shopware v6.5.6.0

##### Please note: this is an example to demonstrate how the structure could look like. Ignore and ditch this PR if unsolicited.

## Abstract

This minor version comes with improvements to HTML Sanitizer, logging, Admin Worker, updated UUID to version 7 and a lot of other features and closed bugs. See below for more details.

## System requirements

* tested on PHP v8.0, v8.1 and v8.2
* tested on MySQL v8
* from now on, Shopware needs the PHP library `bcmath` in order to function properly. You may install it with `$ apt install php-bcmath` on your linux machine. We already added it to our [system requirements](https://docs.shopware.com/en/shopware-6-en/first-steps/system-requirements) page.

## Improvements

### HTML Sanitizer

We got a lot of feedback on the HTML Sanitizer, which was introduced with Shopware 6.5. Based on this feedback, we adjusted the Sanitizer to allow more elements and attributes. Furthermore with this release it is also possible to turn off this feature completely:

	# config/packages/z-shopware.yml
	shopware:
	    html_sanitizer:
	        enabled: false

### Logging

We have excluded a bunch of Exception which are triggered by "wrong" user interactions, for example the `PluginNotInstalledException`.

### UUIDv7

With this release we changed the default UUID format to UUIDv7, to improve the insert performance of the Database. In the local benchmarks this change brings a reduction of 138s to 121s when creating 10000 demo data products.

See [#3086](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/pull/3086) for more information.

# Release notes Shopware 6.5.8.6

## Abstract

This patch release contains several bug fixes.

It also contains a housekeeping issue which adds support for "Google Consent Mode v2".

The decision to include this issue in a patch release was made due to the short time remaining until using v2 becomes mandatory, by March 2024.
This is not a feature, it is an adjustment to the way Shopware communicates with Google's APIs.

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3
* tested on MySQL 8.0.33, MariaDB 10.4. 10.5, 10.11 & 11.0

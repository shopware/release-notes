# Release notes Shopware 6.6.2.0

## Abstract

Besides a list of 44 bug fixes, this minor release contains some cool improvements, especially for developers, for example typescript support for extensions, automatic compiling of JS/SCSS of plugin sub-bundles, meteor component library in administration etc.

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.3
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.11

## Improvements

### Typescript support for webpack config in extensions

Extensions can now use typescript (.ts and .cts) files for their webpack configuration.

### JavaScript/SCSS of plugin sub-bundles now automatically compiles during the plugin activation/deactivation

* When a plugin is registering additional sub-bundles `\Shopware\Core\Framework\Plugin::getAdditionalBundles`, those bundles can also bring their own JavaScript/CSS. Previously, the JavaScript/CSS of sub-bundles was not automatically detected and re-compiled after the plugin was activated or deactivated. Now Shopware also detects JavaScript of sub-bundles and automatically executes `theme:compile` after plugin activation/deactivation.
* When a plugin is registering additional sub-bundles \Shopware\Core\Framework\Plugin::getAdditionalBundles, those bundles can also bring their own JavaScript/CSS. Previously the plugin Javascript/CSS was not automatically detected and compiled if it was only inside the sub-bundles on the plugin activation or deactivation. Now Shopware also detects JavaScript/CSS of sub-bundles and automatically executes `theme:compile` after plugin activation/deactivation.

### Added meteor component library to the administration

The [Meteor component library](https://shopware.design/meteor-components/) was added as a new dependecy to the administration. All library components are now also directly available in the administration.

### Sync option for CLI theme commands

The `theme:compile` and `theme:change ` command now accept `--sync` option to compile themes synchronously. The `--sync` option is useful for CI/CD pipelines when at runtime, themes should be compiled async, but during the build process you want sync generation.

### Improved License Key Handling and Error Reporting in Shopware

* Instead of breaking the Shop, an incorrect license domain is now logged and treated as if no license exists. This eliminates the need for manual system_config changes and cache clearing.
* Shopware now provides a 5-minute leeway for license key issuance and expiry to accommodate system time discrepancies. If the time discrepancy exceeds 5 minutes, a proper exception is now thrown.
* Introduced a new command for showing License information: `commercial:license:info`.

### Order Approval improvements

The order approval got improved with a new UI to create approval rules. Additional the approval rules can now be extended with custom rules. Lastly, the payment authorization can now be automated with the Flow Builder.

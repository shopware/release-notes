# Release notes Shopware 6.6.10.2

## Abstract

This minor release contains two bug fixes.

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.3
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.11

## Fixed bugs

* [PR-7132:](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/pull/7132) With https://github.com/symfony/symfony/pull/59781, the definition *mailer.default_transport* was removed and set as a simple alias. Therefore it could not be accessed anymore in a compiler pass. But this should also be not necessary anymore.
* [PR-7121:](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/pull/7121) In languages, which use Apostrophes a lot (like French), the storefront broke because escaping was missing.

## Abstract

This patch release contains

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.3
* tested on MySQL 8.0.33, MariaDB 10.4. 10.5, 10.11 & 11.0

## Improvements

### Added new store-api endpoints for product and category breadcrumbs
With these new endpoints, you can now fetch the breadcrumbs for a product or category. This is useful if you want to display the breadcrumbs in a custom storefront.

Example GET requests for **category**:  
`{{baseUrl}}/breadcrumb/{id}?type=category` // one DB call less, if you know the type provide it for category  
`{{baseUrl}}/breadcrumb/{id}` // but in general type is optional

Example GET requests for **product**:  
`{{baseUrl}}/breadcrumb/{id}?referrerCategoryId={categoryId}`  
`{{baseUrl}}/breadcrumb/{id}` // default type is product

If you do not provide a `referrerCategoryId` for the product, the main seo category of the product will be used.

Response structure looks like this _(name and path are always present, seoUrls are optional)_:
```json
{
    "breadcrumb": [
        {
            "name": "Home, Jewelry & Games",
            "categoryId": "019192b9b59b713c96b80559e8838d5c",
            "type": "page",
            "translated": {
                "customFields": {},
                "slotConfig": null,
                "linkType": null,
                "internalLink": null,
                "externalLink": null,
                "linkNewTab": null,
                "description": "Deserunt similique necessitatibus illum voluptatibus fugiat voluptatem ullam. Quia iste cum sequi qui.",
                "metaTitle": null,
                "metaDescription": null,
                "keywords": null
            },
            "path": "Home-Jewelry-Games/",
            "seoUrls": [
                {
                    "id": "019192bab2247371acf6efb3af10bea8",
                    "pathInfo": "/navigation/019192b9b59b713c96b80559e8838d5c",
                    "seoPathInfo": "Home-Jewelry-Games/"
                }
            ],
            "apiAlias": "breadcrumb"
        }
    ],
    "apiAlias": "breadcrumb_collection"
}
```

### Improved the tax calculation for the shipping costs
The tax calculation for the shipping costs has been improved. Now we could decide which kind of line item should be aware of the shipping costs. This is useful if you want to calculate the tax for the shipping costs based on the products in the cart or not.

### Improved DAL
Added interval DAL field type to the DAL entity generator.

Added fields with the state attribute to the field collection for attributed entities.

### TWIG update
Updated the Twig version to minimum 3.14.0.

## System requirements

* tested on MySQL 8.0.33, MariaDB 10.4. 10.5, 10.11 & 11.0

## Improvements

### Improved Aggregatiuon name validation

Aggregation names are now restricted to not conain question marks or colons to prevent unprivileged sql injections.

### Improved Context objects

From now on methods from `Context` objects only accepts closures as callbacks, instead of `callables`.

### Screenreader improvements for product listing and listing filters

With this version we added new include parameters to our listing and filter components in the storefront. These should improve acessibility using screenreaders. For example we added the `ariaLabel` parameter to all of our filter components that can be used to add a descritpion of purpose of this filter for screen readers.

### Screenreader improvements for slider elements

In this version we added new behaviour and styling to slider and gallery elements in the storefront. These changes include:

* Hiding cloned elements for screen readers.
* Keeping the focused element always in view to enable navigation of the slider via tab.
* Prevent the native scrolling to focused elements of the browser inside the slider to use the slider function instead.

### Improved ManyToMany association of entities via attributes

With this changes entities created by attributes now supports ManyToMany associations with version aware entities.

Thanks to [nickygerritsen](https://github.com/nickygerritsen) for this improvement.

### Added support for state machine fields

State machine state fields can now be created via attributes in your entity definitions. The attribute is taking an `machine` and `scopes` as well as the well known `api` and `clolumn` arguments.

Thanks to [Simone Alers](https://github.com/dorxy) for this improvement.

### Country States are now available in flows with order data

### Improved CSV parsing for Quick Orders

We added support for different delimiters in CSV files you can pass in the Quick Order module. Supported delimiters next to `,` are now `;` and `|`

### Support FeatureFlagExtension in plugins

We added the possibility to enable the major Feature Flag in your tests using our PHPUnit extension. With this you can run your tests with the major Feature Flag enabled. This can be usefull to find deprecations in your code. To enable the PHPUnit extension add it to your `phpunit.xml`:

```xml
<extensions>
    ...
    <bootstrap class="Shopware\Core\Test\PHPUnit\Extension\FeatureFlag\FeatureFlagExtension"/>
</extensions>
```

And register your test namespace in your test bootstrap file:

```php
FeatureFlagExtension::addTestNamespace('Your\\Unit\\Tests\\Namespace\\');
```

### Added telemetry abstraction layer

By implementing a telemetry abstraction layer, we provide a unified way to integrate monitoring tools into the Shopware platform. This approach simplifies the process of adding telemetry to the application and ensures consistency across different monitoring tools.

For more informations see this [ADR](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/trunk/adr/2024-07-30-add-telemetry-abstraction-layer.md) and the [README.md](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/trunk/src/Core/Framework/Telemetry/README.md) of our new Telemetry namespace

### Added System health checks

By implementing system health checks, we ensure that the system is monitored and that issues are detected early. This will help to prevent system failures and improve the overall stability of the system.
Moreover, it helps detecting issues at the time of deployment and helps to prevent issues from reaching the end-users.

For more informations about our new Health Check Framework see this [ADR](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/trunk/adr/2024-08-02-system-health-check.md)

### Minor accessibility improvements for the Storefront

We've enhanced the registration form, and improved text scalability to ensure everyone can navigate and enjoy our platform with ease.

### Restrict the message queue size

- Added `Shopware\Core\Framework\MessageQueue\Subscriber\MessageQueueSizeRestrictListener` to limit the message queue message size to 256KB. It only creates a log entry if a message is bigger than 256KB.
- Deprecated MessageQueue message size. Messages bigger than 256KB will throw an exception with Shopware 6.7

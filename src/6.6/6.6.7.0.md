# Release notes Shopware 6.6.7.0

## Abstract

This minor release contains some interesting features as well as technical improvements like Accessibility improvements and OpenTelemetry enhancements.

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.3
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.11

## Improvements

### Sales Channel Domain Mapping missing page

Previously, when you tried to access the shop with an unknown URL, Shopware showed an exception page. Now we show a page that this domain is not configured with steps how to configure it.

### Accessibility improvements

This release contains several accessibility improvements to make Shopware more accessible for everyone like:

- Improved text formatting in the storefront
- Improved navigation in account order page using the keyboard

### Improvments to the Administration Text Editor

The text editor in the administration generates now `<p>` tags instead of `<div>` tags for better semantics. Also the editor will now wrap loose text nodes to fix rendering issues.

### Dependency Updates

We updated several dependencies to their latest versions like `opensearch-php` to fix deprecations on PHP 8.4. We still have some deprecations 

### Improvments to Health check

The command `bin/console system:check` now has a new option `--format` to output the results in different formats like `json` or `table` for better processing of the results.

### Breadcrumb API for Store-API

We added a new dedicated API endpoint to fetch the breadcrumb of a product or category. This is useful if you want to display the breadcrumb of a product in a custom storefront.

To get more information about the new endpoints, please check the [changelog entry](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/21da8447ae6681d1187e255efb287ae59faed061/changelog/_unreleased/2024-02-01-add-store-api-endpoints-for-product-and-category-breadcrumb.md)

### Sitemap Proxy for external stored sitemaps

It's possible to store the sitemap files in an external storage like S3. But search engines does not allow to crawl the sitemap files from an external site. To solve this problem we added a new proxy endpoint, which serves the sitemap from the same domain, but loads the file from the external storage.

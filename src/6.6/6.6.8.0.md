# Release notes Shopware 6.6.8.0

## Abstract

This minor release contains several improvements like in redis configuration, category and product indexing as well as the introduction of pinia in admin menu. Additionally, 50+ bugs have been fixed.

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.3
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.11

## Improvements

### Improve Redis configuration for platform

Redis is used in different places of Shopware, like cache, increments/locks/number ranges/messenger statistics.

To make it easier to configure and to have a better overview of the configuration, we improved the Redis configuration structure. There are few breaking changes, so please check the [changelog entry](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/997d9c7fbf8848d623e4eff4aaa95d4fad16e130/changelog/_unreleased/2024-10-04-improved-redis-config-structure.md) for more information.

### Improve category and product indexing for many entities at once

To prevent exceeding the message size limit when indexing many entities at once, we improved the indexing process to split the entities into smaller chunks.

### Migrate admin-menu.store to pinia

The `adminMenu` store has been migrated from Vuex to Pinia. The store is now available as a Pinia store and can be accessed via `Shopware.Store.get(‘adminMenu’)`.

### Added support for opensearch sigv4 credential provider

We added the support for authentication with AWS OpenSearch using the SigV4 credential provider

### Added interface to support copy in batches

As a manufacturer of a flysystem adapter I want to be able to use the writeBatch-possibilities with a dedicated Interface until flysystem supports it out-of-the-box.

### Added vue to shopware object

# Release notes Shopware 6.6.5.0

## Abstract

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.3
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.11

## Improvements

### Added default value for augmented-reality

Previously, you first have to switch to the media, search for the file, and activate AR. Now, you can enable AR by default in the media settings. This way, 3D files will automatically have AR enabled when presented in the storefront.

### Added error handling to HttpClient js

For backwards compatibility, added an errorHandling Parameter to HttpClient to handle errors internally if the plugin does not want to handle errors in every call by itself.

### Added API routes list endpoints

Added endpoints that return the list of available API routes. Use `/api/_info/routes` for the available API routes for the Admin and `/store-api/_info/routes` for the Store API.

### Changed scoring of search terms

Improved product search term scoring to provide better search results on exact matches.

### Changed Webhook Cleanup

Changed the webhook cleanup to only cleanup successfully delivered or permanently failed webhook events. Thus preventing race conditions where the cleanup task might delete webhook event entries that are still running or being retried.

### Add skip to content link to improve a11y

This improves a11y because a keyboard or screen-reader user does not have to "skip" through all elements of the page (header, top-bar) and can jump straight to the main content if wanted. The "skip to main content" link will not be visible, unless it has focus.

### Deprecating Meteor Admin SDK public SDK

Recently, the need arose to deprecate the `Meteor Admin SDK` public API built into the Shopware Core. We need to be able to deprecate the public API, which consists of `component sections` and `data sets`.

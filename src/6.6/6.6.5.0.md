# Release notes Shopware 6.6.5.0

## Abstract

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.3
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.11

## Improvements

### Added default value for augmented-reality

Previously, you first have to switch to the media, search for the file, and activate AR. Now, you can enable AR by default in the media settings. This way, 3D files will automatically have AR enabled when presented in the storefront.

### Added error handling to HttpClient js

For backwards compatibility, added an errorHandling Parameter to HttpClient to handle errors internally if the plugin does not want to handle errors in every call by itself.

### Added API routes list endpoints

Added endpoints that return the list of available API routes. Use `/api/_info/routes` for the available API routes for the Admin and `/store-api/_info/routes` for the Store API.

### Changed scoring of search terms

Improved product search term scoring to provide better search results on exact matches.

### Changed Webhook Cleanup

Changed the webhook cleanup to only cleanup successfully delivered or permanently failed webhook events. Thus preventing race conditions where the cleanup task might delete webhook event entries that are still running or being retried.

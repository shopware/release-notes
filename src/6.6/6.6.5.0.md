# Release notes Shopware 6.6.5.0

## Abstract

This minor release contains some interesting features as well as technical improvements like impersonation (thanks to [Benjamin Wittwer](https://github.com/akf-bw)!), improved search and AR handling. Additionally, 50+ bugs could be fixed.

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.3
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.11

## Improvements

### Added customer impersonation feature (administration)

This release introduces the customer impersonation feature, which was one of the most requested features by the community for the Shopware 6 administration. This feature was previously part of Shopware 5, yet missing in Shopware 6. With this release, it is now fully implemented in Shopware 6; thanks to [Benjamin Wittwer](https://github.com/akf-bw) for this contribution! As a user in the administration, you can choose from the available sales channels and sales channel domains to log in as a customer. The feature can be used by users with the "api_proxy_imitate-customer" permission in the administration on the customer detail page. It is also fully compatible with the headless sales channel type.

### Added default value for augmented-reality (plans only)

Previously, you first had to switch to the media, search for the file, and activate AR. Now, you can enable AR by default in the media settings. This way, 3D files will automatically have AR enabled when presented in the storefront.

### Added error handling to HttpClient js

For backwards compatibility, we added an errorHandling Parameter to HttpClient to handle errors internally if the plugin does not want to handle errors for every call by itself.

### Added API routes list endpoints

Added endpoints that return the list of available API routes. Use `/api/_info/routes` for the available API routes for the Admin and `/store-api/_info/routes` for the Store API.

### Changed scoring of search terms

Improved product search term scoring to provide better search results on exact matches.

### Changed Webhook Cleanup

We changed the webhook cleanup to only clean up successfully delivered or permanently failed webhook events. Thus, preventing race conditions where the cleanup task might delete webhook event entries that are still running or being retried.

### Add skip to content link to improve a11y (accessability)

This improves a11y because a keyboard or screen-reader user does not have to "skip" through all elements of the page (header, top-bar) and can jump straight to the main content if wanted. The "skip to main content" link will not be visible, unless it has focus.

### Deprecating Meteor Admin SDK public SDK

Recently, the need arose to deprecate the `Meteor Admin SDK` public API built into the Shopware Core. We need to be able to deprecate the public API, which consists of `component sections` and `data sets`.

### Deprecated automatic state change for `Shopware\Core\Checkout\Payment\Cart\PaymentHandler\DebitPayment`

The default payment method "Direct debit" will no longer automatically change the order state to "in progress". Use the flow builder instead, if you want to keep the former behaviour.

### Default payment method removed
We deprecated a lot of routes, classes, methods, templates and blocks that are related to the default payment method of a customer. The default payment method of a customer is removed and the last used payment method will always be the one chosen during login.
This includes the remove of the rule builder condition `customerDefaultPaymentMethod`. Existing rules with this condition will be automatically migrated to the new condition paymentMethod, meaning the currently selected payment method.
Also, the trigger `checkout.customer.changed-payment-method` is removed from the flow builder, since customers do not have default payment methods anymore. Existing flows will be automatically disabled with Shopware 6.7 and removed.

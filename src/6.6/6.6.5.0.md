# Release notes Shopware 6.6.5.0

## Abstract

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.3
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.11

## Improvements

### Added default value for augmented-reality

Previously, you first have to switch to the media, search for the file, and activate AR. Now, you can enable AR by default in the media settings. This way, 3D files will automatically have AR enabled when presented in the storefront.

### Added error handling to HttpClient js

For backwards compatibility, added an errorHandling Parameter to HttpClient to handle errors internally if the plugin does not want to handle errors in every call by itself.

## Fixed bugs

## Credits

Thanks to all our contributors for helping us improve Shopware with every pull request!

# Release notes Shopware 6.6.10.0

## Abstract

This minor release contains 

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.3
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.11

## Improvements
### Upgrade to Symfony 7.2
* Changed `symfony/*` dependencies to `^7.2`

### Addition of MySQLInvalidatorStorage
* Added a new MySQL cache invalidator storage so you can take advantage of delayed cache invalidation without needing Redis (Redis is still preferred).

### [A11y-HTML] Offer HTML alternative to our pdf standard documents
* Added HTML alternative to our pdf standard documents

### Introduce global template data for language and navigation
* Added global template data for language and navigation

### Introduce Edge Side Includes for header and footer
* Added ESI for header and footer

### Bulk entity extension
* Deprecated EntityExtension::getDefinitionClass. It will be replaced by `EntityExtension::getEntityName`, which needs to return the entity name.

Before:

```php
<?php

namespace Examples\Extension;

use Shopware\Core\Content\Product\ProductDefinition;
use Shopware\Core\Framework\DataAbstractionLayer\EntityExtension;

class MyEntityExtension extends EntityExtension
{
    public function getDefinitionClass(): string
    { 
        return ProductDefinition::class;
    }
}
```

After:

```php
<?php

namespace Examples\Extension;

use Shopware\Core\Content\Product\ProductDefinition;
use Shopware\Core\Framework\DataAbstractionLayer\EntityExtension;

class MyEntityExtension extends EntityExtension
{
    public function getEntityName() : string
    {
        return ProductDefinition::ENTITY_NAME;
    }
}
```

### Using external URL for media's path without storing physical files
* You can now store media paths as external URLs using the admin API. This allows for more flexible media management without the need to store physical files on the server.

**Example Request:**

```http
POST http://sw.test/api/media
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": "01934e0015bd7174b35838bbb30dc927",
    "mediaFolderId": "01934ebfc0da735d841f38e8e54fda09",
    "path": "https://test.com/photo/2024/11/30/sunflowers.jpg",
    "fileName": "sunflower",
    "mimeType": "image/jpeg"
}
```

### Add aggregate admin api
* Added generic `/api/aggregate/{entityName}` API. It is similar to already existing `/api/search/${entityName}`, but without loading entities

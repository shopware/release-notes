# Release notes Shopware 6.6.10.0

## Abstract

This minor release contains 

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.3
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.11

## Improvements
### Upgrade to Symfony 7.2
* Changed `symfony/*` dependencies to `^7.2`

### Addition of MySQLInvalidatorStorage
* Introduced `\Shopware\Core\Framework\Adapter\Cache\InvalidatorStorage\MySQLInvalidatorStorage` to collect and handle cache invalidations in MySQL as an atomic operation.
* This new storage option allows delayed cache invalidation without requiring Redis (though Redis remains the recommended solution).
* To switch to MySQL for delayed cache invalidation, update your configuration as follows:
```yaml
shopware:
    cache:
        invalidation:
            delay: 1
            delay_options:
                storage: mysql
```

### [A11y-HTML] Offer HTML alternative to our pdf standard documents
* Besides the existing PDF document which is based on DOMPDF, we added our standard document as HTML documents which are fullfilling the A11y criteria.

### Introduce global template data for language and navigation
* Added new Twig function sw_breadcrumb_full_by_id to get the full breadcrumb for a category ID.
* Added \Shopware\Storefront\Framework\Twig\NavigationInfo to the global shopware Twig variable, to provide the ID of the main navigation and the current navigation path as ID list.
* Added minSearchLength to the global shopware Twig variable, which defines the minimum search term length.
* Added showStagingBanner to the global shopware Twig variable, which defines if the staging banner should be shown.
* Deprecated the global showStagingBanner Twig variable. Use shopware.showStagingBanner instead.
* Deprecated the usage of the header and footer properties of page Twig objects outside the dedicated header and footer templates. Use the following alternatives instead:
    * context.currency instead of page.header.activeCurrency
    * shopware.navigation.id instead of page.header.navigation.active.id
    * shopware.navigation.pathIdList instead of page.header.navigation.active.path
    * context.saleschannel.languages.first instead of page.header.activeLanguage
* Added new optional parameter serviceMenu of type \Shopware\Core\Content\Category\CategoryCollection to \Shopware\Storefront\Pagelet\Footer\FooterPagelet. It will be required in the next major version.

### Introduce Edge Side Includes (ESI) for header and 
With the next major version the header and footer will be loaded via ESI. Due to this change many things were deprecated and will be removed with the next major version, as they are not needed anymore (Please refer to the changelog for a detailed list of associated deprecations).

* This changes are currently behind the `cache_rework` flag.
* The header and footer are now loaded via ESI. This allows to cache the header and footer separately from the rest of the page.
* Two new routes `\header` and `\footer` were added to receive the rendered header and footer.
* The rendered header and footer are included into the page with the Twig function `render_esi`, which calls the previously mentioned routes.
* Two new templates `src/Storefront/Resources/views/storefront/layout/header.html.twig` and `src/Storefront/Resources/views/storefront/layout/footer.html.twig` were introduced as new entry points for the header and footer.
* Make sure to adjust your template extensions to be compatible with the new structure. The block names are still the same, so it just should be necessary to extend from the new templates.

### Removal of the asterisk next to every price
* When activating the `ACCESSIBILITY_TWEAKS` feature flag the price asterisk * are no longer displayed next to every price. A text link for tax and shipping information is displayed instead.

### Bulk entity extension
* Deprecated EntityExtension::getDefinitionClass. It will be replaced by `EntityExtension::getEntityName`, which needs to return the entity name.

Before:

```php
<?php

namespace Examples\Extension;

use Shopware\Core\Content\Product\ProductDefinition;
use Shopware\Core\Framework\DataAbstractionLayer\EntityExtension;

class MyEntityExtension extends EntityExtension
{
    public function getDefinitionClass(): string
    { 
        return ProductDefinition::class;
    }
}
```

After:

```php
<?php

namespace Examples\Extension;

use Shopware\Core\Content\Product\ProductDefinition;
use Shopware\Core\Framework\DataAbstractionLayer\EntityExtension;

class MyEntityExtension extends EntityExtension
{
    public function getEntityName() : string
    {
        return ProductDefinition::ENTITY_NAME;
    }
}
```

### Using external URL for media's path without storing physical files
* You can now store media paths as external URLs using the admin API. This allows for more flexible media management without the need to store physical files on the server.

**Example Request:**

```http
POST http://sw.test/api/media
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "id": "01934e0015bd7174b35838bbb30dc927",
    "mediaFolderId": "01934ebfc0da735d841f38e8e54fda09",
    "path": "https://test.com/photo/2024/11/30/sunflowers.jpg",
    "fileName": "sunflower",
    "mimeType": "image/jpeg"
}
```

### Add aggregate admin api
* Added generic `/api/aggregate/{entityName}` API. It is similar to already existing `/api/search/${entityName}`, but without loading entities

# Release notes Shopware 6.6.4.0

## Abstract

This release improves our payment handlers, jest runner, and state management, alongside a transition to an event-based extension system. Key bug fixes enhance overall system stability and address critical issues in Shopware.

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.3
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.11

## Improvements

### Improve payment handlers & general payment process

The payment handler has become quite complex over the years. It's time for a much-needed refactor to make it clearer and more maintainable.

* [More info](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/930fb3445d35d999e9ed6456c52d9cbe169d6fd0/changelog/_unreleased/2024-05-13-improve-payment-handlers.md)

### Add jest runner with disabled compat mode

Currently, our component tests in Jest are running with enabled compat mode. To remove the compat mode for each
component we need to add a new Jest runner with disabled compat mode to make sure that the tests are running without
compat mode.

* [ADR](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/930fb3445d35d999e9ed6456c52d9cbe169d6fd0/adr/2024-06-12-add-jest-runner-with-disabled-compat-mode.md)

### Transition from Vuex to Pinia (Administration)

Deprecated Vuex implementation and use Pinia implementation instead. All Shopware states will become Pinia Stores and will be available via Shopware.Store , `Shopware.State` related is now deprecated.

* [More info](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/7c170d3fb0754ce9671bb00a0fd949a80fc74d96/changelog/_unreleased/2024-06-20-replace-vuex-with-pinia.md)

### Transition to an Event-Based Extension System (Core)

In our current Core architecture, we rely heavily on PHP decoration, Adapter, and Factory patterns to allow for extensions and customizations by third-party developers. While these patterns are effective, they present significant challenges like Backward and Forward Compatibility, Process Extension Limitations, ... .To address these challenges, we have decided to transition to an event-based extension system. This new approach will replace the existing decoration, Adapter, and Factory patterns as the primary method for extending and customizing our system.

* [ADR](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/930fb3445d35d999e9ed6456c52d9cbe169d6fd0/adr/2024-06-18-extended-event-system.md)

### Improve composer executions while plugin lifecycle

Previously, when a plugin was installed, it updated all the composer packages, which was very ineffective. With the new improvement:

- Only directly affected package dependencies are updated
- Lock the version of composer/composer to not update himself
- Do not run composer commands when the Shop is in cluster mode

### Remote thumbnail generation

With these changes, we allow the possibility of disabling the filesystem thumbnail generation. You can then use an external CDN service to handle the thumbnails. As the consequence, when the remote thumbnail config is enabled, the thumbnail images and thumbnail records in the database are not generated.

* [Changes](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/7c170d3fb0754ce9671bb00a0fd949a80fc74d96)
* [Detail](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/7c170d3fb0754ce9671bb00a0fd949a80fc74d96/changelog/_unreleased/2024-05-21-disable-thumbnail-generation-and-use-fastly.md)

By default, the config is disabled, you can enable the remote thumbnail generation by override the `config/packages/shopware.yaml`

```yaml
remote_thumbnails:
    enable: true
    pattern: '{mediaUrl}/{mediaPath}?width={width}'
```

For example, consider a scenario where you want to generate a thumbnail with a width of 80px.
With the pattern set as `{mediaUrl}/{mediaPath}?width={width}`, the resulting URL would be `https://yourshop.example/abc/123/456.jpg?width=80`.

### Remove unwanted aria-live attributes from sliders

By default, all Storefront sliders/carousels (`GallerySliderPlugin`, `BaseSliderPlugin`, `ProductSliderPlugin`) are adding an `aria-live` region to announce slider updates to a screen reader.

In some cases this can worsen the accessibility, for example when a slider uses "auto slide" functionality. With automatic slide the slider updates can disturb the reading of other contents on the page.

You can now deactivate the `aria-live` region on the slider plugins with the new option `ariaLive` (default: `true`).

Example for `GallerySliderPlugin` (Also works for `BaseSliderPlugin` and `ProductSliderPlugin`)
```diff
{% set gallerySliderOptions = {
    slider: {
+        ariaLive: false,
        autoHeight: false,
    },
    thumbnailSlider: {
+        ariaLive: false,
        controls: true,
        responsive: {}
    }
} %}

<div data-gallery-slider-options='{{ gallerySliderOptions|json_encode }}'>
```

When `ariaLive` is `false` it will omit the `aria-live` region in the generated `tiny-slider` HTML code:
```diff
<div class="tns-outer" id="tns3-ow">
-    <div class="tns-liveregion tns-visually-hidden" aria-live="polite" aria-atomic="true">
-        slide <span class="current">2</span> of 6
-    </div>
    <div id="tns3-mw" class="tns-ovh">
        <!-- Slider contents -->
    </div>
</div>
```

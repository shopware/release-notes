# Release notes Shopware 6.6.4.1

## Abstract

Besides other bugfixes, this release contains a security fix. Please update as soon as possible.

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.3
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 10.11

## Fixed bugs

* [NEXT-36813](https://issues.shopware.com/issues/NEXT-36813) | Administration Component `<sw-select-number-field>` not working
* [NEXT-37115](https://issues.shopware.com/issues/NEXT-37115) | Browser crashes when editing Shopping Experiences
* [NEXT-37140](https://issues.shopware.com/issues/NEXT-37140) | Search suggest route - Possible Denial of Service (DoS) entry point? (0 votes), see explanation below:

This release contains a security update. The potential effects of the behavior without the patch are not critical, but could possibly lead to the database server being overloaded and the store no longer being accessible.

The security-relevant fix NEXT-37140 adds a new restriction for the maximum length of SQL queries.

Currently, the maximum length is unrestricted, after updating the maximum length is set to 300 chars. This is a sensible default and in most cases, the shop will not be affected by this limitation.

In a few special cases it may be necessary to set a higher limit. In that case, the new default limit of 300 can be adjusted by adding a new entry to the file **config/packages/shopware.yaml**

The config option is as follows:

    shopware:
      search:
        term_max_length: 300

Here, "300" must be replaced by a value that meets the requirements of the store. This adjustment is only necessary if extensions are used that generate database queries that are longer than 300 characters.

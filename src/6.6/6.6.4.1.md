### NEXT-37140

This release contains a security update.

The potential effects of the behaviour without the patch are not critical but could lead to the database server being temporarily overloaded and the store no longer being accessible.

There is no known exploit at the time of release. The fix in NEXT-37140 is a precaution.

The fix adds a new restriction for the maximum length of SQL queries.

Before Shopware v6.6.4.1, the maximum length was unrestricted; this fix restricts it to 300 characters after updating. 300 is a sensible default; in most cases, the shop will not be affected by this limitation.

Setting a higher limit in a few exceptional cases may be necessary. Â  
In that case, the new default limit of 300 can be adjusted by adding a new entry to the file `config/packages/shopware.yaml`.

The config option is as follows:

```yaml
shopware:
  search:
    term_max_length: 300
```

Here, "300" must be replaced by a value that meets the store's requirements. This adjustment is only necessary if extensions generate database queries that are longer than 300 characters.

More information on configuring your installation can be found [in the documentation](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/guides/hosting/configurations/).

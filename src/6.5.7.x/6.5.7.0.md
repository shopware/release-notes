# Release notes Shopware 6.5.7.0

## Abstract

Besides new features which will be announced later this week, this minor release contains a lot of improvements and changes for developers as well as 69 bug fixes. We could merge pull requests from 18 community developers, thanks for that! 

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.1 and 8.2
* tested on MySQL 8.0.33, MariaDB 10.4. 10.5, 10.11 & 11.0

## Improvements

### Deprecated SEO URLs for Headless Sales Channels

With this release, we deprecated the SEO URLs for headless sales channels. This will be removed in 6.6. If you need SEO URLs in a headless environment, please use the Storefront Sales Channel type or a custom sales channel type using a custom plugin.

[PR](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/9d6d58b075898dc181a2626ae0c0eefd0f342cb6)

### Disabled Doctrine Database Profiler in CLI

When the Symfony Profiler was installed, it collected database queries in the CLI, even in production mode. We disabled it now completely in CLI regardless of the current environment Shopware is running.

### Support for Maintenance mode in Store-API

The maintenance configuration of Sales Channels is now respected in headless store-api requests. When the maintenance mode is active, you will get a 503 http error as response.

[PR](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/commit/df8833a46a1c370d52234f2190d848b148e981ca)

### Media Path refactoring

We refactored the media path handling to persist the media paths instead of recalculating in any request. This allows the media entity to be queried only with the path. Previously, the complete media entity needed to be loaded to generate the path.

```http
POST /api/search/product

{
    "fields": [
        "name",
        "cover.path"
    ]
}
```

### Improvements to logging

As in the previous releases, we continued to improve the logging of Shopware. Hence, we added more logging or down-ranked non-relevant errors to noises to keep the logs clean for important messages.

### Deprecated LoggerFactory

We deprecated the LoggerFactory for plugins for 6.6 as this does not consider the project configuration of logging. Our suggested replacement is to use Monolog Channels, which works in any Shopware 6 version. Please also see the PayPal plugin as an example of our implementation:

- https://github.com/shopware/SwagPayPal/blob/7.3.0/src/Resources/config/packages/monolog.yaml
- https://github.com/shopware/SwagPayPal/blob/7.3.0/src/SwagPayPal.php#L200-L217

### New low_priority queue

We introduced a new queue, `low_priority`, in addition to the already existing `async` queue. This queue can be used by plugins, to queue up messages which are not important in a short manner.

The existing `messenger:consume` or admin watcher will consume the new queue without configuration changes. With Shopware 6.6, it becomes required to setup an additional `messenger:consume` or just append the queue additionally to the existing one `messenger:consume async,low_priority`

### Improved plugin:create

The `plugin:create` command now can generate:

- console command
- scheduled task
- event subscriber
- storefront controller
- store-api route

We are working right now also on a `dal:migration:create` to generate migration files automatically by comparing your entity definition with the current database schema. So stay tuned!

### Soft delete of custom entities on App uninstall

Custom Entities created by Apps will now be soft deleted, so that you can preserve the app data on uninstallation.

### System update now uses the regular kernel

The commands `system:update:prepare` and `system:update:finish` now use the regular kernel while updating Shopware. This fixes a lot of issues when plugins extend root components like Symfony Configuration or created themes.

### MySQL 8.2 support

We fixed some internal queries of DAL to be able to support MySQL 8.2.

### And many more things

* Paginated pages in listing are now HTTP cached
* Improved performance *order_line_item* migration
* Removed *ManyToManyIdFieldUpdater* in *LandingPageIndexer*
* Optimized SEO lookup queries

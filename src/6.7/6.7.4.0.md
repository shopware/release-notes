# Release notes Shopware 6.7.4.0

## Abstract

This minor release provides some interesting improvements under the hood for more stability, performance and software robustness. Additionally, this release comes with at least 148 bug fixes.

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.4
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 11

## Improvements

### Add message queue message size limit configuration option [#13007](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/pull/13007)

Added shopware.messenger.message_max_kib_size config option to define the maximum size (in KiB) of messages in the message queue. Set to 0 to disable the size check. Defaults to 1024 KiB (1 MiB).

### Add save media modal [#12146](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/pull/13007)

This implements save media modal. Save media modal can be opened by Admin SDK [https://github.com/shopware/meteor/issues/819](https://github.com/shopware/meteor/issues/819).

### Prevent sending multiple page change events when query parameters change [#13203](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/pull/13203)

This change stops dispatching page changed events, if only query parameters changed.

### Separate Vimeo video cookies [#13096](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/pull/13096)

Vimeo and YouTube videos shared the same cookie consent in Shopware's storefront. When a user accepts the "YouTube video" cookie, both YouTube _and_ Vimeo videos are loaded, violating proper GDPR compliance. Additionally, videos required a page reload to display after accepting cookies, creating a poor user experience.

Users should have granular control over which video platforms they consent to, and videos should load immediately upon consent.

This change introduces separate cookie consent handling for Vimeo and YouTube videos.

* Videos now load immediately when cookies are accepted (via "Accept all" or cookie configuration offcanvas)
* No page reload required
* Each video type independently checks its specific cookie

### Add possibility to set fetchpriority high in images [#13070](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/pull/13070)

Formerly, there was no way to add the attribute `fetchpriority="high"` to an image, loaded by the CMS image element. As it always depends on the content this should not be done automatically, but rather configurable.

This change adds a setting to add this attribute to the image. In this case we also do not use the `loading="lazy"` option.

### Apply new screen design to installer [#13191](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/pull/13191) 

This change applies a new screen design to the installer and cleans up the former behaviour.

### Remove datepicker wrapper [#12948](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/pull/12948) 

Formerly, there was a wrapper around the mt-datepicker to correct styling issues with the meteor component. The component `mt-datepicker` styling has now been corrected so this wrapper could be removed.

### Make product detail review form radio keyboard accessible [#13046](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/pull/13046) 

The review rating radio buttons were not focusable because they used `display: none`. We updated the radio buttons to be visually hidden using `visually-hidden()` instead, making them focusable. Additionally, I added a box-shadow to the star label when its child radio is focused, so keyboard users have a visual indicator. Also, the vertical alignment between the stars and the rating text were improved.

### Fix Vite vulnerability in admin [#13149](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/pull/13149) 

Bumped and pinned vite version due to vulnerability and audit fail: [GHSA-93m4-6634-74q7](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-93m4-6634-74q7).

This is actually not security relevant for us or Shopware users as the vulnerability is just happening at the dev-server of vite. An attacker would have to have explicit access to the network of the local dev server which is not exposed at any point.

### Add sitemap entity query events for products, landing pages, and categories [#13082](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/pull/13082) 

When changing the products which are shown in the sitemap, formerly it was necessary to decorate the `ProductUrlProvider`. However, it could be much more efficient, when "modifying" the query directly. This is why we added an event to modify the query builder when fetching products, landing pages and categories.

Please checkout the [changelog](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/v6.7.4.0/CHANGELOG.md) for more detailed information.

# Release notes Shopware 6.7.2.0

## Abstract

Shopware 6.7.2.0 focuses on performance, developer experience, and stability. Highlights include OpenSearch query and sorting optimizations, more efficient property filter loading, dynamic sidebar category loading, and improvements to the administration search indexing. This release adds new extension points (like Cart Rule Loader and Guest Logout events), the ability to use custom route names in the Storefront, additional endpoints in the Storefront OpenAPI schema, and UI extension points for sidebar apps. It also includes numerous bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements.

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.4
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 11

## Improvements

### Performance Improvements

Multiple performance bottlenecks were resolved, mainly addressing negative performance impact with growing data sets.

#### Optimized OpenSearch Querying for product listing

The way that sorting is handled when using OpenSearch was greatly improved in cases where translated fields where used for sorting, e.g. product names.

Additionally, the queries were optimized to prevent nested queries, further improving performance. Overall, this can improve the OpenSearch query time by up to 85%.


#### Dynamic category level loading

The category tree's loading was changed so that the active levels for the sidebar navigation are loaded dynamically to always show available child categories, independently of the `navigation depth` setting in the sales channel config.

This means that the `navigation depth` setting is now mainly responsible for the header navigation depth. 
In cases where that setting was increased to support deeper nesting levels in the sidebar navigation, it can be set to a lower value again, which will positively affect performance.

#### Optimized property group loading

The way in which the property groups for listing filters are loaded was improved. This mainly involved optimizing the SQL queries to avoid pagination (which gets slower with more data) and perform fewer joins.
Additionally, the sorting of the properties in the group was improved to use a more performant algorithm. 
This will improve the performance of loading the property filters by up to 50%, especially with a large number of property filters.

### Efficiency Improvements

#### Lower memory footprint on data imports

Memory usage, especially when importing a lot of custom fields, could be greatly reduced by reusing dynamic field definition objects and more efficient validator constraint caching.

Additionally, a memory leak in HTMLSanitize was fixed, which increased memory usage the more sanitized fields were written in a single request. 

This makes shopware more memory efficient, especially when writing bigger batches of data in a single request.

#### More efficient administration OpenSearch indexing

The indexing for the administration search indices on OpenSearch was improved to only reindex entities when search-relevant data was changed and not directly when any change happened to the entity.

### Return address in documents

The option `Display company` address in the `Company settings` section of the document configuration is now split into `Display return address` and `Display company address`.  
The former toggles the display of the return address above the customer address in the address block.  
The latter toggles the display of the company address below the header on the right-hand side of the document.

### Quality of Life Improvement: Administration forwards to the correct path after Login

When you open the administration with a deep link (e.g. to product list or order page), and you'll get redirected to the login first, you will now be forwarded to the original page you wanted to visit after sucessful login instead of always landing on the dashboard after login.

### More custom field set support in Apps

Apps can now also register custom field sets for the `Unit` and `Newsletter Recipient` entities.

### Better accessibility with ARIA labels

Slider links now include descriptive text that can be read by screen readers, making it easier for people with visual impairments to navigate your content.

### Faster loading with fetchpriority 

This improves the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), an important metric for PageSpeed and Google’s Core Web Vitals.

In Adminstration panel, a new config setting for fetchpriority to image slider and image gallery in CMS configuration was added.

### More control with configurable meta robots tags

Decide whether certain pages should be indexed by search engines or not. This gives you more flexibility and helps avoid issues like duplicate content.

It is also possible to override global settings for individual categories, landing pages etc. Open the respective entity, go to SEO tab and set the Meta robots option as needed.

### More improvements

* App user change – API requests can now be executed in the context of a specific app user.
* Storefront OpenAPI schema – extended with additional GET methods.
* Symfony profiler – cart data is now visible in the profiler.
* Cart rule loader extension event – new event for extending cart rules.
* Custom route names – custom route names for storefront routes are now possible.
* App custom fields – support for the unit and newsletter_recipient entities.
* New commands – commands to schedule and deactivate tasks.
* Guest logout manipulation event – new event for guest logout processes.
* Sidebar apps in CMS detail pages – apps can now also be integrated into CMS detail pages.

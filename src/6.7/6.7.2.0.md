# Release notes Shopware 6.7.2.0

## Abstract

Shopware 6.7.2.0 is a significant minor release focused on enhancing performance, developer experience, and stability. It introduces major performance improvements, including OpenSearch query optimizations, dynamic category loading, and more efficient property group filtering. For developers, it adds powerful new extension points like the Cart Rule Loader event, Guest Logout event, and Sidebar UI extension points for Apps in the CMS editor, alongside API schema definition improvements and custom route naming. The release also brings important user-facing fixes for pricing, tax display, and navigation caching. In total, this release addresses over 150 bugs and improvements thanks to the contributions of 11 external contributors.

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2, 8.3 and 8.4
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 11

## Improvements

### Performance Improvements

Multiple performance bottlenecks were resolved, mainly addressing negative performance impact with growing data sets.

#### Optimized OpenSearch Querying for product listing

The way that sorting is handled when using OpenSearch was greatly improved in cases where translated fields where used for sorting, e.g. product names.

Additionally, the queries were optimized to prevent nested queries, further improving performance. Overall, this can improve the OpenSearch query time by up to 85%.


#### Dynamic category level loading

The category tree's loading was changed so that the active levels for the sidebar navigation are loaded dynamically to always show available child categories, independently of the `navigation depth` setting in the sales channel config.

This means that the `navigation depth` setting is now mainly responsible for the header navigation depth. 
In cases where that setting was increased to support deeper nesting levels in the sidebar navigation, it can be set to a lower value again, which will positively affect performance.

#### Optimized property group loading

The way in which the property groups for listing filters are loaded was improved. This mainly involved optimizing the SQL queries to avoid pagination (which gets slower with more data) and perform fewer joins.
Additionally, the sorting of the properties in the group was improved to use a more performant algorithm. 
This will improve the performance of loading the property filters by up to 50%, especially with a large number of property filters.

### Efficiency Improvements

#### Lower memory footprint on data imports

Memory usage, especially when importing a lot of custom fields, could be greatly reduced by reusing dynamic field definition objects and more efficient validator constraint caching.

Additionally, a memory leak in HTMLSanitize was fixed, which increased memory usage the more sanitized fields were written in a single request. 

This makes shopware more memory efficient, especially when writing bigger batches of data in a single request.

#### More efficient administration OpenSearch indexing

The indexing for the administration search indices on OpenSearch was improved to only reindex entities when search-relevant data was changed and not directly when any change happened to the entity.

### Return address in documents

The option `Display company` address in the `Company settings` section of the document configuration is now split into `Display return address` and `Display company address`.  
The former toggles the display of the return address above the customer address in the address block.  
The latter toggles the display of the company address below the header on the right-hand side of the document.

### Quality of Life Improvement: Administration forwards to the correct path after Login

When you open the administration with a deep link (e.g. to product list or order page), and you'll get redirected to the login first, you will now be forwarded to the original page you wanted to visit after sucessful login instead of always landing on the dashboard after login.

### Configurable minimum search length

You can now define how many characters a search query must have before results are shown. This can help reducing irrelevant searches like for “a” or “an”.

By default, Shopware sets the minimum search term length to 3 characters, which means any query shorter than that will be ignored. Go to **Settings → Shop → Search** and add your minimum number to the field labeled "Minimum characters for search". To ensure the changes take effect, rebuild the search index. This is typically done under **Settings → System → Caches & Indexes → Search** (or Live Search)**.

### More custom field set support in Apps

Apps can now also register custom field sets for the `Unit` and `Newsletter Recipient` entities.

### Better accessibility with ARIA labels

Slider links now include descriptive text that can be read by screen readers, making it easier for people with visual impairments to navigate your content.

### Faster loading with fetchpriority 

This improves the Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), an important metric for PageSpeed and Google’s Core Web Vitals.

In Adminstration panel, a new config setting for fetchpriority to image slider and image gallery in CMS configuration was added.

### More control with configurable meta robots tags

Decide whether certain pages should be indexed by search engines or not. This gives you more flexibility and helps avoid issues like duplicate content.

Go to **Settings → Shop → SEO** in admin panel. In SEO settings, you'll now find options for Meta robots tags for diffenet page types like Categories, Products and also for  Custom CMS pages. For each page type, you can select **index, follow**, **noindex, follow** and so on. 

It is also possible to override global settings for individual categories, landing pages etc. Open the respective entity, go to SEO tab and set the Meta robots option as needed.

### App user change

API requests can now be executed in the context of a specific app user so that Change history & audit logs show the correct user. Additionally, permissions and ownerships can be respected properly.

#### How to use it

You can now specify the user context for API calls when your App authenticates, for example via manifest.xml. Typically, this is done by sending the `sw-context-token` or an OAuth token linked to the desired user. Add the header `sw-app-user: <user-id>` or use the API token tied to that user, so that any API call like `POST /api/product` runs under that user's name. 

In **Administration → Settings → System → Users & Permissions**, each user has a UUID. That UUID is used in the API request header to switch context.

### Storefront OpenAPI schema

Extended with additional GET methods.

1. Store API Product Listing (/store-api/product-listing/{categoryId})

* What it does: This is the core endpoint for fetching a paginated list of products for a given category. It handles all the complex filtering, sorting, and association loading needed for a category page. Before this, the OpenAPI schema likely lacked a complete definition for this crucial endpoint. Documenting it properly allows frontend developers and third-party integrators to understand the exact request and response structure for category navigation.

2. Store API Product Detail (/store-api/product/{productId})

What it does: This endpoint retrieves all the detailed information for a specific product, including its variants, media, prices, configurator settings, and more. Similar to the listing endpoint, formally adding this to the schema provides a official contract for the data returned on a product detail page, which is essential for headless commerce implementations.

### Symfony profiler

Complete cart data like line items, price calculations, transactions etc. can now be observed in Symfony profiler toolbar. Now, you can get a complete, clean, and organized view of the cart's state on any page load without interrupting the execution flow, dramatically speeding up development and troubleshooting.

### Cart rule loader extension event

The `RuleLoaderEvents::LOADER_EXTENSION_EVENT` is a powerful new hook that allows developers to bypass the limitations of the visual rule builder. It injects custom, PHP-based business logic directly into the process that determines which promotions are applied to the cart, greatly expanding the possibilities for creating sophisticated and dynamic promotions.

This event is an "extension point." It doesn't let you change the rules themselves, but it allows you to add entirely new conditions or logic on top of the existing rule system.

The classic problem it solves, for example, could be 

* Discount applies if it's the user's birthday

### Custom route names

Yet another big win for developers, specifically those needing more control over URL generation and SEO in their Shopware themes and plugins. It allows developers to assign a unique, custom identifier to any page route in the storefront. This custom name can then be used to generate the URL for that page anywhere in the code, making it much more reliable, robust and maintainable.

Now, anywhere in your code (Twig templates, controllers, services), you can generate the URL for this page using the clear, semantic name you chose (`frontend.deals.of.the.day`) instead of the less descriptive internal ID (`your_plugin.deals.page`).

This change gives developers the freedom to define meaningful, project-specific names for their routes, leading to cleaner, more maintainable, and less brittle code when dealing with URLs in the storefront.

### App custom fields

This is a straightforward and powerful extension of the App API. It grants app developers two new "hooks" (unit and newsletter_recipient) to integrate more deeply with Shopware's data model, enabling more sophisticated and specialized applications.

It extends that capability to two new, important entities:

* unit: The entity that represents a product's measurement unit (e.g., "kg", "piece", "liter", "cm").
* newsletter_recipient: The entity that stores information about someone who has signed up for a newsletter.

App developers can now attach their own custom data to these entities.

### Commands to schedule and deactivate scheduled tasks

These new commands are powerful administrative tools. They move control of Shopware's background processes from a purely code-based configuration to something a system administrator or developer can manage dynamically via the command line, greatly improving flexibility for maintenance, debugging, and testing.

1. `bin/console scheduled-task:schedule "Swag\Example\MyCustomTask"`: Manually triggers the immediate execution of a scheduled task, regardless of its next scheduled run time.
2. `bin/console scheduled-task:activate "scheduled_task_entity_name"` and it's counterpart `scheduled-task:deactivate`: allows you to en- or disable a scheduled task for immediate execution or it will not run automatically until it is activated again.

### Guest logout manipulation event

The `GuestLogoutEvent` is a targeted, useful extension point that provides developers with the ability to execute code precisely when a guest user logs out, primarily enabling robust abandoned cart saving mechanisms and other session-end triggers for guest customers. It's a classic quality-of-life improvement for developers building advanced e-commerce features. This event is specifically and only fired for guest logouts, making it a clean, targeted hook.

#### Practical use cases:

* Abandoned cart saving for guests
* Audit logging
* Cleaning up custom session data
* Third-party integrations

### Sidebar apps in CMS detail pages

This change moves App integration deeper into the content creation process. It's no longer just about managing data (products, orders, customers) but now also about enhancing and assisting the very creation of the storefront experience itself. It's a significant step towards making the Shopware Admin a truly extensible platform for all aspects of e-commerce.

This feature allows Apps to inject their custom UI components (like buttons, forms, information panels) into the sidebar of the CMS element detail editor. Now, they can also integrate directly into the workflow of building and configuring pages.

This opens up a whole new category of App functionality focused on content management and enrichment, for example, an SEO App could analyze the text and images in the currently selected element and provide a real-time SEO score and suggestions directly in the sidebar.

Use the **manifest.xml** file to define this new "module" and, crucially, specify its location to target the CMS element sidebar:

```
            <module 
                name="seo-element-sidebar"
                parent="sw-cms-detail" 
                source="https://my-app.com/cms-element-sidebar">
                <label>SEO Assistant</label>
            </module>
```

`parent="sw-cms-detail"`: This is the magic. It tells the Admin to load this App's component into the detail view of a CMS element.

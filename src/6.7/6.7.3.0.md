# Release notes Shopware 6.7.3.0

## Abstract

The language handling completely moved to the core, no plugin necessary from now on. Also, American English is pre-installed as one of the default languages. Additionally, this release comes with at least 161 bug fixes.

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.4
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 11

## Improvements

### Language handling

#### American English can become default language in Shopware

American English is now another default language besides British English and German in a new shop installation.

You can even use it as your default system language when installing Shopware.

#### Language management in core

No language plugin needed any more for installing other than default languages! The entire plugin was built into the core. Simply fetch and activate the language of your choosing from the administration panel. Additionally, new `bin/console` commands have been provided to support your project deployment.

You will fetch Shopware translations from [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/shopware6), which are stored on [Github](https://github.com/shopware/translations/). You can even help providing translations and utilize them in your shop a short time later!

Please note: As community translations are provided on Crowdin, we cannot give guarantee that everything is translated 100% correct.

Good thing: The Language Pack plugin will be maintained for Shopware versions < v6.8.0.

Please see [ADR](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/trunk/adr/2025-06-03-integrating-the-language-pack-into-platform.md) for more details.

#### Derived language dialects

Translations might become kind of complex when it comes to dialects, like Spanish as spoken in Argentina vs. "continental" Spanish. The same goes for English in several variations like en-GB and en-US. Basically, all of it is just one language like 'es' for Spanish and 'en' for English in roots. As formerly, we had to maintain the same set of "snippets" or language keys for both, American and British English; we now have a stamm language for English. Additionally, there'll be localized languages files overwriting the stamm, for example 'cart' vs. 'trolley', 'delivery' vs. 'shipment' or even 'gimme the check' vs. 'could I have the bill please cheers mucker-mate, tara'. This way, one could even maintain it's own local accent like Northerner Brit English vs. Cockney - if wanted - with a little effort entering just the different slang words.

### CMS / Shopping Experience

#### Block type labels

See the type of blocks directly when working with it as an editor. This is especially useful if using third party plugins. Thanks to [@amenk](https://github.com/amenk)!

#### 3D/canvas switching

Slider viewers are now rendered in respect to their visibility modus. This gives us a bit of more performance. Thanks to [@ffrank913](https://github.com/ffrank913) ;)

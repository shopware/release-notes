# Release notes Shopware 6.7.3.0

## Abstract

The language handling completely moved to the core, no plugin necessary from now on. Also, American English is pre-installed as one of the default languages. Additionally, this release comes with at least 161 bug fixes.

## System requirements

* tested on PHP 8.2 and 8.4
* tested on MySQL 8 and MariaDB 11

## Improvements

### Language handling

#### American English can be used in installer

American English can now be downloaded in the installer and can become the default shop language like any other language in Shopware.

#### Available languages can be managed from Shopware core

No plugin needed anymore to install languages available from the [Shopware translation platform](http://translate.shopware.com)! The entire plugin has been built into the core. Simply fetch and activate the language of your choice via the new `bin/console` commands. Later, this feature will become available in administration.

However, for any other language pack not available from the Shopware  translation platform, you will still need a plugin.

You can fetch Shopware translations from the Shopware translation platform, which are stored on [Github](https://github.com/shopware/translations/). You can even help provide translations and use them in your shop a short time later!

Please note: As these are community-provided translations, we cannot guarantee that everything is translated 100% correctly.

Good news: The Language Pack plugin will continue to be maintained under our usual [release policy](https://developer.shopware.com/release-notes/).

Please see the [ADR](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/trunk/adr/2025-06-03-integrating-the-language-pack-into-platform.md) for more details.

### Country-Agnostic Language Layer

Working with language codes in Shopware, such as `en-GB` (a combination of language and country), generally works well. However, this approach can be quite maintenance-heavy: using multiple dialects, for example, British and American English, always leads to duplicated language snippets and can quickly become frustrating for translators.

To address this, we introduced an additional translation layer that reduces dialects to patch files, limiting duplication to only a small portion of the snippets.

Read the full story in this [ADR](https://github.com/shopware/shopware/blob/trunk/adr/2025-09-01-adding-a-country-agnostic-language-layer.md). You can also find a detailed [concept document](https://developer.shopware.com/docs/concepts/translations/fallback-language-selection.html) for further reference.

### CMS / Shopping Experience

#### Block type labels

See the type of blocks directly when working with it as an editor. This is especially useful if using third party plugins. Thanks to [@amenk](https://github.com/amenk)!

#### 3D/canvas switching

Slider viewers are now rendered in respect to their visibility modus. This gives us a bit of more performance. Thanks to [@ffrank913](https://github.com/ffrank913) ;)
